## Thanks for visiting!

Hi! Thanks for stopping by! I'm really glad to meet you! :)

I'm Robert, an engineering student and aspiring researcher.

This website is currently a work-in-progress, so it's not quite done yet. But if you have any questions for me (or just want to chat), I'd be thrilled if you [sent me an e-mail](mailto:bahensky.robert@gmail.com "send Robert an e-mail")!
